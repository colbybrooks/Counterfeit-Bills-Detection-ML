# Counterfeit-Bills-Detection-ML

Given data set that provides 4 features per bill and whether the bill was genuine or counterfeit.  Using Machine Learning algorithms and the measurements provided, I built a predictor to determine whether a bill is genuine or counterfeit from these features.  
* Best Prediction was K-Nearest Neighbor with  `Accuracy 100%` & `Combined Accuracy 99.93%`

Using several machine learning algorithms over a dataset involving Banknote Authentication.  Algorithms include Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Learning, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbor with a Accuracy Table for each algorithm.  In addition, a descriptive statistical analysis, and a Pairplot & Cross Covariance Matrix are created for visualization are ran over the dataset in another file.
