# Counterfeit-Bills-Detection-ML
Using several machine learning algorithms over a dataset involving Banknote Authentication.  Algorithms include Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Learning, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbor with a Accuracy Table for each alg.  In addition, a descriptive statistical analysis &amp; visualization are ran over the dataset in another file.
