# Counterfeit-Bills-Detection-ML
Using several machine learning algorithms over a dataset involving Banknote Authentication.  Algorithms include Perceptron, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Learning, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbor with a Accuracy Table for each alg.  In addition, a descriptive statistical analysis &amp; visualization are ran over the dataset in another file.   

## Requirements
- Python 3 
### Packages
- `numpy` 1.16.5 ++  http://www.numpy.org/

I used the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) Environment to install these packages with additional, with Jupyter Notebook and Spyder IDE in addtion
Other method to just download packages is [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
